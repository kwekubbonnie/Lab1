Submission for codes for Data Structures class [Lab 1]

Instructions:
In this repository i have wtitten two python programs.

The first program (Prime Numbers).
This program takes in user input and the proceeds to compute if it is a prime number or not.
A user must input a number.
The program checks if the number is divisible by 1 and the number itself
The program returns if the number is prime or if it is not

The secon  progrma (Palindrome)
This program takes in an input of string from a user
It then proceeds to check if this string is palinedrone . ie, if the string reads the same from front to back and back to front
This program returans if the word is a palindomr by reversing the word in another variable
It then compares the variable to itsel to see if it s a match
It returns if it is not a variable if the string does not read the same both ways.
